### 6. Backend API Tests

#### Test Guest API Endpoint
```bash
# Get random city as guest
curl -X GET http://localhost:10000/api/guest/random-city \
  -H "User-Type: guest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "city": {
    "name": "Mumbai",
    "lat": 19.076,
    "lon": 72.8777,
    "aqi": 156,
    "pm25": 65.2,
    "pm10": 120.5,
    "lastUpdated": "2025-10-06T..."
  }
}
```

#### Test Restricted Endpoint as Guest
```bash
# Try to track a city as guest (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/cities/track \
  -H "User-Type: guest" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cityName":"Delhi","latitude":28.7041,"longitude":77.1025}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "This feature is not available for guest users. Please register or login to access this feature.",
  "error": "GUEST_RESTRICTION"
}
```

## Expected Behavior Summary

### Guest Users Can:
‚úÖ Login without credentials
‚úÖ View random city data (basic AQI, PM2.5, PM10)
‚úÖ Access health recommendations
‚úÖ See their guest status in navbar
‚úÖ See upgrade prompts

### Guest Users Cannot:
‚ùå Add custom cities from map
‚ùå Track specific cities
‚ùå Access detailed pollutant analysis
‚ùå View comparison charts
‚ùå Remove tracked cities
‚ùå Refresh tracked cities data

### Authenticated Users Can:
‚úÖ Everything guests can do, plus:
‚úÖ Add cities from map
‚úÖ Track unlimited cities
‚úÖ Access detailed analysis
‚úÖ View all pollutant data
‚úÖ Compare cities
‚úÖ Remove and refresh cities

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Guest restrictions not applied
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors, ensure `guestFeatures.js` is loaded before other scripts

### Issue 2: Guest can add cities from map
**Solution**: Check that `User-Type: guest` header is being sent, verify backend middleware is applied

### Issue 3: Authenticated users see restrictions
**Solution**: Check that `localStorage.getItem('userType')` is not set to 'guest', verify token is valid

### Issue 4: Health tab not accessible
**Solution**: Check that health tab is not accidentally restricted in frontend code

## Browser Console Commands

### Check Current User Type
```javascript
console.log('User Type:', localStorage.getItem('userType'));
console.log('User Data:', localStorage.getItem('user'));
console.log('Token:', localStorage.getItem('token'));
```

### Manually Set Guest Mode (for testing)
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('userType', 'guest');
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({ name: 'Guest User' }));
location.reload();
```

### Clear Authentication (logout)
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('token');
localStorage.removeItem('user');
localStorage.removeItem('userType');
location.href = '/';
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All guest restrictions implemented
‚úÖ Guest users see appropriate error messages
‚úÖ Authenticated users retain full functionality
‚úÖ No JavaScript errors in console
‚úÖ No backend errors in server logs
‚úÖ Visual indicators clearly show guest status
‚úÖ Upgrade prompts encourage registration
‚úÖ Health recommendations accessible to all
