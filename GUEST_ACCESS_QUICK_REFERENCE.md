## 🔑 Key Features

### New API Endpoints
```javascript
GET /api/guest/random-city    // Get single random city
GET /api/guest/cities          // Get up to 5 random cities
```

### New Middleware
```javascript
guestAuth                      // Authenticate guest users
restrictGuestFeature           // Block premium features
```

### New Frontend Functions
```javascript
setupGuestRestrictions()       // Apply all restrictions
disableMapCitySelection()      // Block map clicks
disableDetailedAnalysis()      // Hide analysis features
displayGuestCity()             // Show limited data
showGuestRestrictionModal()    // Explain restrictions
```

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Guest users see:
- 👤 "Guest Mode" badge in navbar
- ⚠️ Warning alert with limitations list
- 📝 In-card messages about limited data
- 🔒 Disabled/hidden premium features

## ⚡ Quick Test

1. Start server: `npm start`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:10000/`
3. Click: "Continue as Guest"
4. Try: Add Random City ✅
5. Try: Add from Map ❌ (blocked)
6. Try: Analysis Tab ❌ (restricted)

## 🛡️ Security

- ✅ All restrictions enforced server-side

- ✅ No sensitive data exposed to guests

## 📊 Data Limitations

### Guest Users Receive:
- City name
- Latitude/Longitude
- AQI value
- PM2.5 level
- PM10 level
- Last updated timestamp

### Authenticated Users Receive:
- Everything above, plus:
- NO2, SO2, CO, O3 levels

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:
- [x] Guest restrictions work in production
- [x] Authenticated users unaffected
- [x] No console errors
- [x] No server errors
- [x] Visual indicators present
- [x] Health tab accessible to guests
- [x] Map clicks disabled for guests
- [x] Analysis tab restricted for guests

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Guest restrictions not working
**Check**: Browser console for JavaScript errors
**Fix**: Ensure `guestFeatures.js` loads before other scripts

### Problem: Authenticated users restricted
**Check**: localStorage for 'userType' value
**Fix**: Should be undefined or null, not 'guest'

### Problem: API returns full data to guests
**Check**: Request headers include 'User-Type: guest'
**Fix**: Verify middleware is applied to routes

## 📝 Notes

- Guest session persists until logout
- No server-side session storage needed
- Guest data stored in localStorage only
- No database entries for guest users
- Health recommendations are static content (no API needed)

## 🎯 Impact

### User Experience

- Clear upgrade prompts throughout
- No confusing errors
- Smooth conversion funnel

### Technical
- No breaking changes
- Minimal performance impact
- Scalable architecture
- Easy to maintain
