## 🧪 What Air Pollution Stuff Does It Track?

### The 6 Bad Things in Air:

1. **PM2.5** 🔬
   - Super tiny particles (smaller than a grain of sand)
   - From cars, factories, and smoke
   - The most dangerous one!

2. **PM10** 💨
   - Slightly bigger particles (still super small!)
   - From dust and construction
   - Can get in your lungs

3. **NO₂** (Nitrogen Dioxide) 🚗
   - Gas from car exhaust
   - Brown-colored air pollution
   - Makes it hard to breathe

4. **SO₂** (Sulfur Dioxide) 🏭
   - From factories and power plants
   - Smells like rotten eggs (yuck!)
   - Can cause acid rain

5. **CO** (Carbon Monoxide) ⚠️
   - Invisible, odorless gas
   - From burning stuff
   - Very dangerous in high amounts

6. **O₃** (Ozone) ☀️
   - Good high in the sky, bad down here
   - Forms on hot, sunny days
   - Makes your eyes water

### 🎯 AQI Score (Air Quality Index)
Think of it like a video game health bar for your city:

- 🟢 **0-50**: GOOD - Go play outside! Perfect air!
- 🟡 **51-100**: MODERATE - Pretty okay, sensitive people be careful
- 🟠 **101-150**: UNHEALTHY (Sensitive) - Kids with asthma should stay inside
- 🔴 **151-200**: UNHEALTHY - Everyone should limit outdoor time
- 🟣 **201-300**: VERY UNHEALTHY - Stay inside if possible!
- 🟤 **301+**: HAZARDOUS - Don't go outside! Serious danger!

### For Developers (People Who Build Websites):

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Tools We Used)
- **Frontend** (What you see):
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Bootstrap 5 (makes it pretty)
  - Chart.js (makes graphs)
  - Leaflet (makes the map)
  
- **Backend** (The brain):
  - Node.js (runs JavaScript on the server)
  - Express (handles web requests)
  - PostgreSQL (database to store data)
  - Sequelize (talks to the database easily)

- **Security**:
  - JWT tokens (proves you're logged in)
  - Bcrypt (scrambles passwords)
  - Input validation (checks if data is safe)

#### 📥 Installation Steps

**Step 1: Download the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pratham2511/Air-Pollution_Tracker.git
cd Air-Pollution_Tracker
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies** (All the tools needed)
```bash
npm install
```

**Step 3: Setup Environment** (Secret settings)
Create a file called `.env` and add:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_PORT=5432
DB_POOL_MAX=5
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRY=24h
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12
EMAIL_USER=your_outlook_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_outlook_password_or_app_password
EXPOSE_OTP_CODES=false
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
PORT=10000
```

> **SMTP on Render:** Outlook/Hotmail SMTP works over TLS on `smtp.office365.com:587`. If you use multi-factor authentication, create an app password and supply it via `EMAIL_PASS`. Render automatically provides HTTPS termination so the API endpoints remain secure.

### 🔐 Security & Access Rules

- **Password policy**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one special character
   - Rejects passwords that include your name/email or match common leaked passwords
- **Email normalization**: addresses are lowercased and trimmed before we store them, so duplicate sign-ups with different casing fail early.
- **Guest mode limitations**
   - Guests only receive the top 5 readings per page and simplified pollutant data.
   - Protected endpoints (create/update/delete) remain locked—guests must register to access them.

**Step 4: Setup Database**
```bash
npm run migrate    # Creates the database tables
npm run seed       # Adds sample data
```

**Step 5: Run It!**
```bash
npm start
```

**Step 6: Open Your Browser**
Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## ☁️ Deploying on Render

1. **Create the services**
   - Provision a *Web Service* from this repository (Node runtime).
   - Provision a *PostgreSQL* instance (Render Free tier works for trials).

2. **Configure environment variables (Render Dashboard → Environment)**
   - `DATABASE_URL` – copy the External URL from the Render PostgreSQL page.
   - `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` – also available on the database dashboard.
   - `JWT_SECRET` – generate a strong secret; do **not** commit it.
   - `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS` – keep at `12` unless you need quicker hashes.
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – comma-separated list of allowed front-end origins (e.g. `https://your-app.onrender.com`).
   - Optional: `DB_POOL_MAX` to adjust the Sequelize pool (defaults to `5`, matching Render Free limits).

3. **Build & start commands**
   - The service uses `npm ci --omit=dev && npm run build` during build.
   - Runtime command is `npm start`, which binds to the `PORT` Render injects.

4. **Database migrations**
   - Run `npm run migrate` against the Render database once (from Render shell or your local machine with the same `DATABASE_URL`).
   - Optionally execute `npm run seed` if you want demo pollution data.

5. **Free tier heads-up**
   - Free Postgres instances have low connection limits; this project caps the pool at five connections to avoid errors.
   - Sleeping services can take ~50s to wake; expect a slow first request.
   - Render deletes free databases on the listed expiry date, so upgrade or back up before then.

## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### 1. **You Visit the Website** 🌐
   - Your browser asks the server: "Show me the website!"
   - Server sends back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### 2. **You Login** 🔐
   - You type email and password
   - Server checks if they match
   - Server gives you a special "token" (like a movie ticket)
   - Browser saves the token

### 3. **You See Cities** 🏙️
   - JavaScript loads city data from `cities.js`
   - Creates colorful cards for each city
   - Shows pollution numbers and colors

### 4. **You Click on Map** 🗺️
   - Map shows 50 cities with markers
   - Click a marker → Get pollution info
   - Add to your list if you want!

### 5. **You See Charts** 📊
   - JavaScript uses Chart.js library
   - Grabs city data from localStorage
   - Draws beautiful bar graphs
   - Updates when you add/remove cities

### 6. **You Get Forecast** 🔮
   - Takes last 3 days of data
   - Uses simple math to predict next 3 days
   - Shows in cards with trend arrows

## 🔑 Important Concepts (Explained Simply)

### 🍪 localStorage
- Like a small notebook in your browser
- Remembers your tracked cities
- Stays even when you close the browser
- Can store about 5-10MB of data

### 🎫 JWT Token
- Like a movie ticket that proves you paid
- Server gives it to you when you login
- You show it with every request
- Expires after 24 hours (like a day pass)

### 🗄️ Database
- Like a giant spreadsheet in the cloud
- Stores all user accounts
- Stores pollution readings
- PostgreSQL = Type of database we use

### 🔒 Encryption
- Scrambles your password so hackers can't read it
- "password123" becomes "sdh872hd*&H*d87"
- Only works one way (can't unscramble!)

### 📡 API (Application Programming Interface)
- Like a waiter at a restaurant
- You tell the waiter what you want (request)
- Waiter brings it from the kitchen (server)
- You get your food (response data)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### Problem: "Nothing shows up on the page!"
**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (Press F12)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl + R)
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### Problem: "Login doesn't work!"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure email is valid (has @ and .com)
2. Password must be at least 6 characters
3. Check if you registered first
4. Try clearing localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`

### Problem: "Map is not loading!"
**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure Leaflet library loaded (check console)
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if browser blocks location access

### Problem: "Charts are invisible!"
**Solution:**
1. Add at least 1 city first
2. Go to Analysis tab
3. Wait 2 seconds for charts to load
4. Check if Chart.js library loaded
